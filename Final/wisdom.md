Remember how long thou has been putting off these things, and how often thou hast recieved an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return.
- Marcus Aurelius

- Ralph Waldo Emerson

Make the most of yourself... for that is all there is of you.

I was waiting
for something extraordinary to happen
but as the years wasted on nothing ever did
unless I caused it.

Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and absurdities no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day. You shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense.
- Ralph Waldo Emerson
